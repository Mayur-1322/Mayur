        "1.\tReadability and Simplicity\n",
        "•\tPython places a strong emphasis on clean, readable code. Its syntax is designed to be highly readable, with minimal use of brackets and a clear layout using indentation and whitespace.\n",
        "•\tPython’s simplicity and readability make it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.\n",
        "2.\tExtensive Standard Library\n",
        "•\tPython comes with an extensive standard library, which is a collection of modules and packages that offer a wide range of functionalities.\n",
        "•\tPython’s standard library includes modules and packages for regular expressions, GUI programming, networking, data processing, and much more. This vast ecosystem ensures that developers have access to a wide array of tools without the need for external dependencies.\n",
        "3.\tCross-Platform Compatibility\n",
        "•\tPython’s cross-platform compatibility allows it to run seamlessly on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Developers can write their code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, saving time and effort in application development.\n",
        "•\tCross-platform compatibility is crucial in modern software development, as it enables applications to reach a broader audience across various devices and operating systems..\n",
        "4.\tDynamic Typing and Dynamic Binding\n",
        "•\tPython is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime. Unlike statically-typed languages, such as C++ or Java, Python does not require explicit type declarations..\n",
        "•\tDynamic binding, another key feature of Python, allows variables to be bound to different objects at runtime.  \n",
        "5.\tStrong Community Support\n",
        "\tPython enjoys a vibrant and supportive community of developers worldwide. This community provides various resources, including forums, online communities, and open-source projects.\n",

        "2) Describe the role of predefined keywords in python and provide example of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning within the language. These keywords are integral to Python's syntax and structure, and they cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) because they are reserved for specific programming functions.\n",
        "Role of Predefined Keywords:\n",
        "1.\tDefining Structure and Flow: Keywords help define the structure of Python code, including loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.\n",
        "2.\tControl Flow: Keywords control the flow of the program, such as determining the execution of blocks of code (e.g., if, else, while, for).\n",
        "3.\tData Management: Keywords like True, False, None, and class help manage data and its behaviour.\n",
        "4.\tException Handling: Keywords such as try, except, finally, and raise are used to handle exceptions and errors in the code.\n",

        "3)Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, objects can be categorized as mutable or immutable based on whether their state (i.e., their data or attributes) can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "Mutable Objects:\n",
        "•\tDefinition: Mutable objects are those that can be modified after they are created. You can change the contents or state of a mutable object without creating a new object.\n",
        "•\tExamples: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and byte arrays are common examples of mutable objects.\n",
        "Immutable Objects:\n",
        "•\tDefinition: Immutable objects cannot be modified after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified content.\n",
        "•\tExamples: Strings, tuples, integers, floats, and frozen sets are common examples of immutable objects.\n",

        "•\tDefinition: Python automatically converts one data type to another without the programmer's intervention. This usually happens when performing operations between different types, where Python tries to prevent data loss or errors.\n",
